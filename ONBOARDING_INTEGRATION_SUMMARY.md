# Onboarding Workflow Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the AI-powered onboarding workflow with the supplier form submission process. The entire supplier onboarding journey is now tracked end-to-end with a unique token system.

---

## üîÑ **Complete Workflow Flow**

### **Step 1: Initiate Onboarding** (`/app/suppliers/onboard`)
1. Admin fills in supplier contact details and business type
2. AI drafts a personalized onboarding email
3. Click "Send Email" ‚Üí Triggers `/api/onboarding/initiate`

### **Step 2: Create Onboarding Record** (`/api/onboarding/initiate`)
1. Generates a unique `onboardingToken` (64-character hex string)
2. Creates `Supplier` record with basic info (status: PENDING)
3. Creates `SupplierOnboarding` record with:
   - Reference to supplier
   - Token for tracking
   - Initial status: INITIATED
   - Current step: INITIATE
4. Returns token to frontend

### **Step 3: Send Email with Unique Link** (`/api/send-email`)
1. Receives onboarding token from initiation process
2. Replaces form links in email template with tokenized URL:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/supplier-onboarding-form?token={onboardingToken}
   ```
3. Sends email via SMTP
4. Updates onboarding record with `emailSent: true`

### **Step 4: Supplier Fills Form** (`/supplier-onboarding-form`)
1. Supplier receives email and clicks link
2. Form page extracts token from URL query parameter (`?token=...`)
3. Supplier fills in all 39 fields and uploads documents
4. Token is automatically included in form submission

### **Step 5: Form Submission & Linking** (`/api/supplier-form/submit`)
1. Extracts `onboardingToken` from form data
2. Finds existing `SupplierOnboarding` record by token
3. **If token exists (workflow-initiated):**
   - Updates existing `Supplier` record with complete details
   - Updates `SupplierOnboarding` record with:
     - `supplierFormSubmitted: true`
     - `documentsUploaded: true`
     - `currentStep: REVIEW`
     - `overallStatus: DOCUMENTS_RECEIVED`
   - Creates timeline entry
4. **If no token (standalone submission):**
   - Creates new `Supplier` and `SupplierOnboarding` records
5. Sends confirmation emails to admin and supplier

### **Step 6: Review & Approval** (`/admin/supplier-submissions`)
1. Admin views supplier submission in dashboard
2. Can view all details, documents, and onboarding history
3. Approves/Rejects/Requests revisions
4. Onboarding workflow status updates accordingly

## üìä **Database Schema Changes**

### **New Field: `SupplierOnboarding.onboardingToken`**

  onboardingToken           String?   @unique  // ‚Üê NEW FIELD
  // ... other fields
}
```

- **Type:** String (nullable, unique)

3. **Rate limiting** on form submission endpoint
4. **CAPTCHA** to prevent spam submissions
5. **SSL/TLS** for all form submissions (HTTPS only)

### **Database Migration:**
```bash
# Already applied via db:push
