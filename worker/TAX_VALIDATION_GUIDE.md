| Document 3-4 months old | +10 points (Medium Risk) |
| Document older than 4 months | +20 points (High Risk) |

| Wrong purpose | +15 points (High Risk) |
| No SARS markers | +25 points (High Risk) |
| Company name mismatch | +20 points (High Risk) |

## Implementation Details

### **File**: `worker/crew_agents.py`
- **Function**: `analyze_document_with_ollama()`
- **Lines**: 262-329 (Tax validation prompt)

### **Form Fields Used**:
```python
{
  "companyName": str,      # Company name - must match taxpayer name
  "physicalAddress": str   # Address for verification
}
```

### **Document Types Validated**:
- Tax Clearance Certificate
- Good Standing Certificate  
- Tax Compliance Status Pin

## Key Compliance Requirements

### **SARS Tax Clearance Requirements:**

1. **Age Limit**: Not older than 3 months
2. **Purpose**: Must state "Good Standing" or "Tax Clearance"
3. **Taxpayer Match**: Taxpayer name = Company name (critical)
4. **Official**: Must have SARS logo and stamps
5. **Complete**: All fields must be filled

### **Acceptable Variations:**

**Company Name**:
- ‚úÖ "ABC (Pty) Ltd" = "ABC Pty Ltd" (acceptable)
- ‚úÖ "ABC Manufacturing" = "ABC Manufacturing (Pty) Ltd" (acceptable if partial)
- ‚ùå "ABC Industries" ‚â† "ABC Manufacturing" (reject)

**Address**:
- ‚úÖ "123 Main St" = "123 Main Street" (acceptable)
- ‚úÖ Short form included in long form (acceptable)
- ‚ùå Different street/city (reject)

## Fraud Detection

### **Red Flags:**
- üö© Taxpayer name completely different from company name
- üö© No SARS logo or official markers
- üö© Document older than 6 months
- üö© Poor quality/photocopied multiple times
- üö© Address in different province/city
- üö© Wrong purpose stated

### **Automatic Rejection Criteria:**
- Taxpayer name doesn't match company name
- Document older than 6 months
- No SARS authentication markers
- Purpose not related to good standing

## Example Tax Reference Numbers

South African tax numbers follow formats:
- **Income Tax**: 10 digits (e.g., 9123456789)
- **VAT**: Starts with "4" (e.g., 4123456789)
- **PAYE**: 7 digits + 3 digits (e.g., 7123456/123)

## Integration with Risk Assessment

Tax validation results feed into overall analysis:

```python
# Critical issues increase risk significantly
if taxpayer_name_mismatch:
    risk_score += 35  # Critical
if certificate_expired:
    risk_score += 20  # High
if wrong_purpose:
    risk_score += 15  # High

Overall Risk: HIGH
Recommendation: REJECT or REQUEST REVISION
```

## Processing Flow

```
Supplier fills form (company name, address)
      ‚Üì
Uploads Tax Clearance Certificate
      ‚Üì
Procurement manager runs AI analysis
      ‚Üì
Ollama extracts:
  - Company name from certificate
  - Taxpayer name from certificate
  - Address from certificate
  - Purpose from certificate
      ‚Üì
Compares each field with form data
      ‚Üì
Validates:
  ‚úì Taxpayer name = Company name?
  ‚úì Purpose = "Good Standing"?
  ‚úì Address matches?
  ‚úì Document age < 3 months?
      ‚Üì
Returns PASS/FAIL for each check
```

## Common Issues

### **Issue**: Taxpayer name format differs
**Example**: 
- Certificate: "ABC MANUFACTURING (PTY) LTD"
- Form: "ABC Manufacturing (Pty) Ltd"
**Solution**: AI recognizes case variations as match

### **Issue**: Purpose says "Tax Compliance Status"
**Status**: Acceptable (equivalent to Good Standing)

### **Issue**: Purpose says "Tender Application"
**Status**: Reject - wrong purpose

### **Issue**: No expiry date shown
**Solution**: Use issue date + 3 months rule

## Validation Summary Table

| Field | Required | Critical | Notes |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| Company Name | Yes | Medium | Must be present |
| Taxpayer Name | Yes | **Critical** | MUST match company name |
| Address | Yes | Low | Partial match acceptable |
| Purpose | Yes | High | Must say "Good Standing" |
| Tax Reference | No | Low | For record keeping |
| Validity Date | Yes | High | Must be < 3 months old |
| SARS Markers | Yes | High | Logo, stamps required |

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- [ ] Validate tax reference number format
- [ ] Check tax compliance status (green/amber/red)
- [ ] Cross-reference with company registration
- [ ] Validate SARS pin authenticity
- [ ] Alert if approaching 3-month limit
- [ ] Check for outstanding tax debt mentions

## Support

For tax validation issues:
1. Ensure certificate shows "Good Standing" purpose
2. Verify taxpayer name exactly matches company name
3. Check document is recent (<3 months)
4. Look for SARS logo and official markers
5. Manual review if AI uncertain about match

## Compliance Notes

- Tax clearance certificates expire after 12 months
- For onboarding purposes, should be <3 months old
- Taxpayer name mismatch is grounds for rejection
- Purpose must explicitly state "Good Standing"
- Missing SARS markers indicate potential fraud
